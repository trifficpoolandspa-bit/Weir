-- 03 - sync support
--
-- Adds what customer sync needs on the server. Safe to run more than once.
--
-- 1. customers.edited_at / edited_by — when the change was actually made on
--    the device, and by whom. updated_at stays the server's own clock, which
--    is what devices use to ask "what changed since I last looked?".
-- 2. customer_versions — every version that loses a last-write-wins conflict
--    is kept here, so an overwritten gate code can always be recovered.
-- 3. push_customer() — the only way the app writes a customer. It does the
--    conflict check, keeps the losing version, and saves, all in one
--    transaction, so a dropped signal can never leave a half-written record.
